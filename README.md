# Sudoku Puzzle Solver


## The main idea of the project is to build a Sudoku puzzle solver. Solver must comply with all the standard Sudoku puzzle rules.

### Sudoku Rules: 

    Sudoku puzzle is a 9-by-9 grid of squares, consisting of 9 Rows, 9 Columns and 9 Blocks.

    1. Sudoku puzzle only uses numbers 1 to 9
    2. Each Row and Column needs to consists of numbers from 1 to 9 with no duplicate values
    3. Each Block (3x3) needs to have all 9 numbers

### Code:

The Solver consists of 3 major functions: 

    1. find_next_empty
    2. is_valid
    3. solve_sudoku

    Function (fcn) find_next_empty loops through the puzzle to find all the empty cells



  list the next steps
    - webscraping the puzzles, reentering them in the website
    - sudoku.com, etc
  see if there is anything to improve
